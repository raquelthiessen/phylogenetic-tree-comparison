================== ASTRAL-Pro ===================== 

This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) version 1.1.6
Using native AVX batch computing.
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
There are 2 threads used to run.
ti: 3
tx: 3
pw: 4
The number of input tree read is 800
12800 trees read from /home/vasenaj/Desktop/phylogenetic-tree-comparison-rt-refactor/data_sets/gene-trees/model.37taxon/noscale.800g.500b/R13/all_gt.tre
800 extra trees.
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at MON
